## How to navigate this repo
This repo is a wrapper repo to the forked [`huggingface/transformer`](https://github.com/jychen630/transformers) repo that aims to implement `TemplateConstraint` and `OrderedConstraint` features under the umbrella of `transformers/generation` module, beam search constrained decoding.

**File directories**

- **generation/**: The core files we changed to the `transformers` library.

- **test/**: Extensive test scripts or test cases for our features implementation.
This directory contains code to evaluate template-constrained and ordered-constrained generation on various language models using beam search. The evaluation compares generation quality, constraint satisfaction, and inference performance across models like `GPT-2`, `BERT`, and `LLaMA-3`.
   - `inference_TemplateConstraint.py`: Inference script for template-constrained generation.
   - `inference_OrderedConstraint.py`: Inference script for ordered-constrained generation.
   - `run_inference.sh`: Runs inference using templates from `because_mode.jsonl`.
   - `run_inference_ordered.sh`: Runs ordered inference from `because_mode_OrderedTemplate.jsonl`.
   - `get_metrics.py`: Script to compute and report metrics including:
   - Template satisfaction accuracy
   - Average generation time per sentence
   - Average time per token

- **demo/**: Our demo web app code and screenshots shown in presentation.

- **assets/**: Miscellenais files like images or other notekeeping files.

## Relation to the `huggingface/transformers` library

According to huggingface transformer repo issue [#27706](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/27706), `TemplateConstraint` is a useful constraint during beam search for constrained decoding. It's desired by the community. In response to this feature request, we implemented the `TemplateConstraint and OrderedConstraint` classes in `src/transformers/generation/beam_constraints.py`. We integrated the constraint workflow with `model.generate()` via corresponding logits processors in `src/transformers/generations/logits_process.py` and test cases in `tests/generation/test_beam_constraints.py`.

## Reproducibility Instructions

To set up a conda environment and install this forked version of the `transformers` library, follow these steps:

1. **Create and activate a new conda environment**:

   ```bash
   conda create --name hpml python=3.10.16
   conda activate hpml
   ```

2. **Install the forked repository**:
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/jychen630/transformers@template_order_constraint
   ```

Our algorimth implementations are entierly reflected on `github.com/jychen630/transformers@template_order_constraint`. That's why you should install our branch on forked version of `transformers`, rather than the official transformer library.
Namely, please dont do `pip install transformers` but do the installation through the https link above.

3. **Install other dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install wandb torch
   pip install 'accelerate>=0.26.0'
   ```

4. To run the test,
```bash
# please make sure to change the sys.insert() in the python files inference_TemplateConstraint and inference_OrderedConstraint to point to local transformers library.
cd test
chmod +x run_inference.sh          # for TemplateConstraint class
chmod +x run_inference_ordered.sh  # for OrderedConstraints class
./run_inference.sh
./run_inference_ordered.sh

```
This runs `inference_TemplateConstraint.py` across combinations of:

Models: `gpt2`, `google-bert/bert-base-cased`, `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct`

Beam sizes: 3, 5

Maximum output lengths: 20, 100

5. After generating output files, run:
```bash
python get_metrics.py
```
This will parse the .jsonl output files and print aggregated metrics including accuracy and inference time statistics.

6. To run the demo, run
```bash
pip install flask
cd demo
python3 demo.py
```

In your local browser, visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. It will render `templates/demo.html`.

### WandB report
- [ðŸ§¾ Template-Constrained Generation W&B Report](https://wandb.ai/rg3637-columbia-university/template-constrained-gen-inference/reports/Template-Constraints--VmlldzoxMjY3OTE4NA?accessToken=methzkvxuzk9rp8zw857xepc9ppqe5syoekq5vacu9lj8q7ejnoe3i94j0shfbwd)

**Observation**
For 100 new tokens, LLaMA-8B achieves up to 98% template accuracy, with further gains expected as token count increases. Despite its smaller size (124M parameters), GPT-2 performs comparably. 

While Slower, Larger Models Increase the Likelihood of Template Satisfaction



### Ordered Constraint
![Accuracy across models (Ordered Constraint)](assets/accuracy_comparison_across_models_template.png)


![Time_per_token across models (Ordered Constraint)](assets/time_per_token_comparison_across_models_ordered.png)

**Observation**
A similar trend in accuracy and time is observed for ordered constraints; however, satisfaction rates decline due to the increased token span required to fulfill the constraint, as any number of intervening tokens are permitted between target words.

While Slower, Larger Models Increase the Likelihood of Template Satisfaction
